### Fraud Detection Model for E-Commerce Companies

According to Juniper research, "E-commerce retailers are at risk of losing over **$20 billion USD in 2021** due to online fraudulent activities" (Trivedi, 2021). This represents a staggering 18% of increase in digital crime as compared to 2020. 

Many E-Commerce companies are struggling to streamline their security systems to ensure their online transactions are based on verified consumer identity. Which makes identity and synthetic fraud among the most common types of online criminal activity. Fraudsters use stolen identity data (like Social Security numbers, addresses and card details) to create a synthetic ID and steal funds from accounts, take out loans, or create new credit lines in the name of the customer (Trivedi, 2021). 

To address this issue I will create a fraud detection model for the E-Commerce Company that will help smaller E-Commerce companies identify potentially fradulent customers and transactions based on digital footprint revealed by analyzed dataset.

## 1. Data

This Datasets consists of 2 csv files both containing information on ecommerce transactions made by customers.

File 1: Customer_DF (1).csv (25.6 kB) File has 10 columns and 167 entries

File 2: cust_transaction_details (1).csv(55.67 kB) File has 11 coulmns and 622 entries

Data Source: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/aryanrastogi7767/ecommerce-fraud-data

The Fraud Detection Model will be develpoed performing proper EDA and feature engineering.

## 2. Data Cleaning

*Data Cleaning Report*

The original data set was comparably clean with no duplicated or missing data.  
I had to reshape & merge data from two separate tables to align customer information with transctions data to train my model on a variaetly of different customer data.

- **Problem 1:** Customer email was identified as a primary key for data merge. There are total 168 entries and just 161 unique emails addresses. To ensure the data integrity, I had to verify if there there are any customer e-mail duplicates associated with different customer data (i.e. IP address, bulling address, customer device and phone number)

- **Solution:** To find duplicated emails I have created a for loop to check for duplicates and save duplicated emails in a list of duplicates.  
 I was able to identify 'johnlowery@gmail.com' as a duplicated email address, which was marked as a Fraud in trandactions dataset. 
 
- **Problem 2:** Address data is adrtess data is concatenated in one column, so I had to sperate State data, to verify if there is any geographically concentrated fraud cases. 
  
- **Solution:** Used str.split() function to separate States, and created new df.States column. 


## 3. EDA

*EDA Report*

- Prelimanry EDA revealed that out of total 2615 orders 9.83% were detected as being fradulent. However, out of 623 transactions the 41.25% were marked as fraud.

- Payment method privider analysis revealed that payment made using 16 digit JCB and Visa cards were less likely to detect fraud fillfilling the majority of the fradulent orders. 

- Additionnaly, a barplot below shows that the likelyhood of all payments attempts above 4 reasult in Fraud.

- The analysis of the geographic spread of Fraudulent activity revelaed that 11% of all detected cases were originated in Winsconsin, followed by 8% in Marshall Islands and 6% in Louisianna.

- The box plot below shows a distinct difference in mean and distribution of orders between fradulent and valid cases.

## 4. Preprossesing and Training Data Development 

- Preprocessing portion of this project involved creation of the dummy variables to prepare categorical features for modeling. According to scaled correlation matrix highest dependencies were detected between Fraud and Number of Orders (0.45), Number of Payment (0.33), and Transaction Amount (0.33).


## 5. Data Modeling
ML Notebook

I chose to work with supervised learning machines, as I am not performing an exploratoty analysis but building my model using the historical data. I have used Logistic Regressor, Random Forest Classifier, and Support Vector Machine based models.   


NOTE: I choose confution matrix as accuracy score mertics. 

WINNER: Random Forest Classifier with accuracy precision of 86%, recall of 0.83 and F1 score of 0.85
